const data2 =  `React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, boasts several key features:

  Component-Based: React follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable and modular UI components. This approach enhances code organization, maintainability, and scalability.

  Virtual DOM: React utilizes a virtual DOM to efficiently update the browser's DOM. Instead of directly manipulating the entire DOM tree, React compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and only updates the necessary components, resulting in improved performance.

  Declarative: React promotes a declarative programming style, where developers specify the desired outcome rather than imperatively defining each step. This simplifies the development process, improves code readability, and facilitates debugging.

  Ecosystem: React boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and extensions, such as React Router for routing, Redux for state management, and Styled Components for styling. This vibrant ecosystem enhances React's capabilities and enables developers to build feature-rich applications efficiently.`;
